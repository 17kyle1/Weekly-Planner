# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description
In this activity, I used Third-Party APIs to design a Work Day Scheduler. 
The criteria involved saved information the user inputs in each time to slot to local storage. In addition, there needed to be color coding on the slots based on the when these tasks occur. 
If they occurred in the past, the slot would be shaded grey. 
If they occurred in the present, the slot would be shaded amber. 
Lastly, if they occurred in the future, the slot would be shaded light green.
